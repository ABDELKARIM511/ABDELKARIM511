<h1>Hi there, my name is ABDELKARIM ER-RAZKI ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>Throughout my scholastic career, I've been mesmerized by coding low-level programs and coding in C language, but that couldn't keep me away from expanding my knowledge in web development.</br></br>
So for that, I choosed to have my first internship with Argyre Technology Services as a full-stack web developer, using Angular and expressJs.</br>
<ul>
  <li>Full-stack web developer.</li>
  <li>Member of "1337 blockchaine developers group" and blockchain enthusiast.</li>
</ul>
<label><i>they call me "weak" in arabic "ada3if".<i></label>
